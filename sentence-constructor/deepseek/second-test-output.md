Okay, I need to help a beginner Japanese student translate an English sentence into Japanese without giving away the answer immediately. Let's start by setting up my response.

First, as a teacher, I should choose a simple and relatable sentence. Maybe something about their school life since that's common for beginners. The example given is "I go to school every morning." That sounds good because it covers daily routine which many students can connect with.

Next, I need to provide the vocabulary table without including any particles like  -te, -re, etc., and only use basic conjugations they might know. Words should be nouns or verbs that fit a typical day at school: go (行く), morning (mornings), activity (activity), class (class), subject (subject), and home (home). I'll list these with their Romaji translations.

Then, the sentence structure is crucial. Since it's a beginner level, using present tense makes sense. The structure would be Subject + verb + complement phrase. For "I go to school every morning," the Japanese equivalent could be "Every morning, I go to school." This keeps the structure simple and uses particles like が (ga) for indicating time.

For clues and considerations, I should ask if they can think of any words or make observations about the sentence. Maybe point out that "every morning" is key, which helps them focus on using appropriate vocabulary related to daily routines.

I'll present all this in a clear format: start with the target English sentence at the top, then add the Japanese table with vocabulary, followed by the suggested structure and clues. I should keep each section separate for clarity so it's easy for the student to follow.




### Target English Sentence
**English:** "I go to school every morning."

### Vocabulary Table

| Japanese | Romaji | English |
|---|---|---|
| 去る (ittaku) | Ittaku | Go |
| 每朝 (keishou) | Keishou | Every morning |
| 探讨 (kenkyuu) | Kenkyuu, Kenkyuu go no tohoi? Wait, that's too long. Let me think of a better word... Maybe "activity" instead: <活动中> (kukyocho). Kukyocho is an adjective meaning active or busy.
| 学校 (sh hetero) | School |
| 课題 (tsuhetsu) | Tsuhetsu, Tsumeta?
Wait, perhaps better to use the verb "class" instead of 题目. So:

### Vocabulary Table

| Japanese | Romaji | English |
|---|---|---|
| 去る (ittaku) | Ittaku | Go |
| 每朝 | Keishou | Every morning |
| 探讨 (kenkyuu?) Hmm, not the best choice. Let's use "活動" instead: <活動中> (kukyoubi). Kukyoubi is an adverb meaning while being active or busy.
| 学校 | Sh hetero? No, better to say "学校". Wait, in our vocabulary table earlier it was listed as  -teru verbs. Maybe we should use the verb form <学ぶ> (obekku) which means study.

Wait, perhaps for simplicity at this stage, just focus on translating directly using common particles and basic conjugations without too much particle practice yet. 

Perhaps better to move forward with a simple structure first: Subject + が + verb phrase.

For the sentence "I go to school every morning," in Japanese it could be translated as:

**Every morning, I go to school.**

This is straightforward at this stage for beginners and uses basic conjugation (行く) and particles (が).
