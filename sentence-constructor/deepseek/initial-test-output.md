### Reasoning text
Alright, I've been given a detailed setup for helping a student learn Japanese by translating English sentences into Japanese. Let's break down what I need to do step by step.

First, as a language teacher with experience at the Beginner and JLPT5 levels, my role is clear: take an English sentence, guide the student through transcription without giving away the answer, provide necessary resources like vocabulary tables and structure examples, and be ready to offer clues or further explanations if needed. 

Looking at the provided XML files, I see there are specific scoring criteria for content organization (categories 2-6) with subpoints each contributing up to five points. This means my output needs to be structured in a way that's easy to assess, probably using categories like English Sentence, Vocabulary Table, etc.

I notice two main components: the Target English Sentence and the Japanese Sentence Attempt. In Setup State, when receiving an English sentence, I need to generate three things—the vocabulary table with nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives in Japanese along with their Romaji translations; a sample sentence structure without particles or tenses; and some initial clues.

For example, if the input is "I have two apples," my response should include words like "have" as a verb, providing both its Japanese form and conjugation. I'll list each term clearly to avoid confusion for beginners.

Next, in Attempt State, when the student provides their attempt at translating that sentence into Japanese, I need to validate it using the provided XML's cross-references. This means checking if they used correct vocabulary from my table and appropriate particles as per standard structures—like "have" followed by a subject and complement particle (which might be omitted for simplicity).

I should also consider common mistakes students make at this level, such as forgetting to conjugate verbs or using incorrect particles. When the student asks questions about learning Japanese, I transition them into Clues State, where I can offer further help without giving away answers.

Throughout all interactions, it's crucial to keep explanations simple and avoid complex terms unless necessary. The goal is to build confidence step by step through positive reinforcement and gradual challenges.

I also need to make sure that the vocabulary table doesn't repeat words or include particles like "benzai," keeping it focused on core structures. Sentence structures should reflect typical beginner patterns, avoiding overly complicated constructions.

In summary, my approach will be methodical: receive English input → provide structured resources → validate attempts using provided criteria and references → offer support when needed. This flow ensures the student progresses systematically towards proficiency.


### Response:

Thank you for sharing this detailed setup for language learning! Let's get started with your first example.

#### **State:** Setup  
**User Input:** "I have two apples."

**Assistant Output:**

- **Vocabulary Table**
  - Conjugated Forms:
    - *have* ( past tense, verb ) → 那么 (N polite) / お amakate (V1)
    - *apples* (noun plural) → 辦�
    - *two* (adjective/demonstrative "2") → 絪二

- **Sentence Structure**
  > 那么 { Adv } 機{ N } { V1 } 絪二 { Num } 达摩{ N }

- **Clues, Considerations, Next Steps:**
    - The word *have* is a verb in English. In Japanese, it can be translated using "お" (V1) for polite form.
    - "Two apples" translates to an adjectival numeral and noun combination.
    - Think about the structure of polite verbs.

**Student Question:** How do you say "I have two apples." in Japanese?

#### **State:** Clues  
**User Input:** *Question: "How do you say 'I have two apples.' in Japanese?"*

**Assistant Output:**

- The sentence structure for this type of statement usually starts with a polite verb (V1) followed by an adjectival numeral and noun.
- Think about how to form the subject and complement.
