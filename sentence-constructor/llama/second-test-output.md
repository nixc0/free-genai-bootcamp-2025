Based on your detailed specification, I will implement a Japanese language teaching system to help students transcribe English sentences into Japanese.

**Code Implementation:**

Here's a simplified implementation of the system using Python:
```python
import re

class Teacher:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vocabulary_table = {}
        self.sentence_structure = {}

    def setup(self, english_sentence):
        # Create vocabulary table and sentence structure based on input English sentence
        vocab_list = ["cold", "office", "heater"]
        for word in vocab_list:
            self.vocabulary_table[word] = {"Japanese": "", "Romaji": word}

        self.sentence_structure["English"] = english_sentence

    def attempt(self, japanese_attempt):
        # Interpret student's Japanese attempt and provide feedback
        try:
            if re.match(".*", japanese_attempt):  # Simple regex check to see if it matches a pattern
                print("Your attempt is correct!")
            else:
                print("Sorry, your attempt does not match the expected structure.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error: {str(e)}")

    def clues(self):
        # Provide clues and considerations based on student's progress
        clue = "Try using から (kara) to connect ideas between sentences."
        consideration = "Remember, particles are crucial in Japanese grammar!"
        next_step = "Make another attempt at transcribing the sentence!"

        return {"clue": clue, "consideration": consideration, "next_step": next_step}

    def run(self):
        # Main loop of the system
        while True:
            user_input = input("Enter 'setup' to start or 'attempt' to try again: ")
            if user_input == "setup":
                english_sentence = input("Please enter an English sentence for transcription: ")
                self.setup(english_sentence)
                print(self.vocabulary_table)
                print(self.sentence_structure)

            elif user_input == "attempt":
                japanese_attempt = input("Enter your Japanese attempt: ")
                self.attempt(japanese_attempt)
            else:
                clue_dict = self.clues()
                for key, value in clue_dict.items():
                    if isinstance(value, str):
                        print(f"{key}: {value}")
```
**Example Usage:**

To use the system:

1. Run the code.
2. Type `setup` to start a new transcription task.
3. Enter an English sentence when prompted (e.g., "The office is cold.").
4. The vocabulary table and sentence structure will be displayed.
5. Attempt to transcribe the sentence into Japanese by typing in your attempt when prompted.

**Note:**

This implementation is simplified for demonstration purposes only. In a real-world application, you would need to handle more complex logic for vocabulary processing, grammar rules, and feedback mechanisms.

Please review this code carefully and let me know if there's anything else I can help with!
